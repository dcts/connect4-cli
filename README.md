# Connect 4 CLI

play a casual game of connect 4 in your terminal. Writen in Rust.

# Tasks
- [ ] Game Logic Implementation
- [ ] Graphics Engine with ASCII game state and menu logic
- [ ] Networking Logic (with `libp2p`, see [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/libp2p-tutorial-build-a-peer-to-peer-app-in-rust) for more info)

### Roadmap
- [ ] Game Logic
  - [ ] end game conditions
  - [ ] detects horizontal 4 connectors
  - [ ] detects vertical 4 connectors
  - [ ] detects diagonal 4 connectors
  - [ ] dropping pins works
- [ ] UI
  - [ ] draw board / game state
  - [ ] draw menu / let user select action
  - [ ] (p2p) show room with peers
  - [ ] IDEA: probably some general menu utility, input your questions with possible functions... Not sure yet
- [ ] P2P User experience
  - [ ] input your name
  - [ ] START or JOIN a game
    - [ ] start => joins room of open games and waits for someone to join...
    - [ ] join  => display all open games! (can select a peer or refresh the page)
  - [ ] make your move... (check for invalid moves)
  - [ ] valid move 
        1. update lokal game state
        2. send move to other client as payload
  - [ ] wait for move from friend
- [ ] OVERKILL FEATURES 
  - [ ] Brutal Mode => both player have same color, remember your position you must

# Graphics Engine Example
## Menu Engine (joining a game)
**Screen 0**
```txt
=== connect-4-cli ===

Welcome! (intro text goes here)

Whats your name?
>
```

**Screen 1**
```txt
=== connect-4-cli ===
Welceome dcts

> (1) Start a Game
> (2) Join a Game

Choose action by typing a number:
>
```

**Screen 2**
```txt
=== connect-4-cli ===

âœ… game created
joining lobby...

LOBBY
    NAME               | ID

    art_brock..........| lkv32v873
    frodo..............| sv7823uzd
    gandalf............| v824hjfvx
        
ðŸ‘€ waitig for someone to join your game ... ðŸ‘€
```

## Playing a Game
- Idea how to structure it
  1. title & info
  2. game state
  3. menu (or loading screen)

```txt
=== connect-4-cli ===

ðŸŸ¡ dcts 
ðŸ”´ gandalf 

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |ðŸ”´|  |ðŸŸ¡|ðŸŸ¡|  |
|  |ðŸŸ¡|ðŸŸ¡|ðŸ”´|ðŸ”´|ðŸ”´|ðŸŸ¡|
*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*

waiting for gandalf to play...

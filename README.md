# Connect 4 CLI

play a casual game of connect 4 in your terminal. Writen in Rust.

# Tasks
- [x] Game Logic Implementation
- [x] Graphics Engine with ASCII game state and menu logic
- [ ] Networking Logic (with `libp2p`, see [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/libp2p-tutorial-build-a-peer-to-peer-app-in-rust) for more info)

# Roadmap
- [ ] P2P User experience
  - [ ] input your name
  - [ ] START or JOIN a game
    - [ ] start => joins room of open games and waits for someone to join...
    - [ ] join  => display all open games! (can select a peer or refresh the page)
  - [ ] make your move... (check for invalid moves)
  - [ ] valid move 
        1. update lokal game state
        2. send move to other client as payload
  - [ ] wait for move from friend

# OVERKILL FEATURES 
- [ ] Brutal Mode => both player have same color, remember your position you must
- [ ] animate drop

## Playing a Game
- Idea how to structure it
  1. title & info
  2. game state
  3. menu (or loading screen)

```txt
=== connect-4-cli ===

ðŸŸ¡ dcts 
ðŸ”´ gandalf 

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |ðŸ”´|  |ðŸŸ¡|ðŸŸ¡|  |
|  |ðŸŸ¡|ðŸŸ¡|ðŸ”´|ðŸ”´|ðŸ”´|ðŸŸ¡|
